# GSoC 2021 Report - Improve and Expand Functionalities in Control Module

<h2>About Me</h2>

I am [Akshansh Bhatt](https://www.github.com/akshanshbhatt), a 2nd year undergraduate student pursuing dual major in Physics and Electronic Engineering at [BITS Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/).

<h2>Project Synopsis</h2>

My project aimed to achieve 3 main goals -

- Complete the unfinished PR(s) and fix bugs from last year's work by [@namannimmo10](https://www.github.com/namannimmo10).
- Make the control module's API more robust and beginner-friendly by add examples related to use cases.
- Add functionalities in the control module that were proposed last year but work didn't start. This mainly included `State Space` class and common plots related to control theory.
