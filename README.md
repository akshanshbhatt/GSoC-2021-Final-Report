# GSoC 2021 Report - Improve and Expand Functionalities in Control Module

<h2>About Me</h2>

I am [Akshansh Bhatt](https://www.github.com/akshanshbhatt), a 2nd-year undergraduate student pursuing a dual major in Physics and Electronics Engineering at [BITS Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/). I was part of the Google Summer of Code 2021 program as a student developer at [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy). You can find my project [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6135134387961856). For information related to my weekly progress in the program, you can check out my [blog posts](https://gsoc-blog.akshansh.me/). I am available for discussions/feedback on this [email id](mailto:qaz.akshansh@gmail.com).

<h2>Project Synopsis</h2>

My project aimed to achieve 3 main goals -

- Complete the unfinished PR(s) and fix bugs from last year's work by [@namannimmo10](https://www.github.com/namannimmo10).
- Make the control module's API more robust and beginner-friendly by adding examples related to use cases.
- Add functionalities in the control module that were proposed last year, but work didn't start. This mainly included `StateSpace` class and common plots related to control theory.

<h2>Work Accomplished</h2>

#### Major PRs

- [#21634](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21634) : Improve `TransferFunction` docs and add `to_expr`
